    <b>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Yes. When you use the Application, we may use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in order to compute imaging satellite overflights and potential imaging times, display a location map with other relevant data overlays, enforce United States embargo restrictions on purchases, enforce satellite operator regional sales restrictions, and to support other current and future Application features such as augmented reality displays. Current location information is used only on the device and is not transmitted off the device and will not be shared with other users or partners unless you choose to initiate an optional transaction, such as the purchase of an archived image or to initiate a New Tasking request. If you initiate such an optional transaction that requests an image of a specified
    location (which may or may not be your current location), Orbit Logic will obtain and share with its partners and third party licensors the location information associated with your request.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
    If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the mobile application in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings and/or within the mobile application. Note that certain features (such as satellite image purchase and augmented reality features) may be disabled when device location services are not available to the Application.
